# GitBot
A ChatBot for navigating GitHub users, repos and organisations

### What is GitBot?
GitBot is a small project to create a GitHub ChatBot for web. It can be used to search for users or repos, and to view their details. It uses JSON responses from https://api.github.com/ and decodes then in PHP and jQuery AJAX.

### Hosting
You can download GitBot and host it on any PHP-enabled server.

### Why?
This ChatBot was created in three days as part of a work experience programme. It will be expanded, but is, for now, in a semi-finished form.

### Expansion
The whole GitBot backend is designed to be expandable, all the questions and answers are editable, and all the functions to perform during the interpretation stage are too. Feel free to create a whole new ChatBot off the back of this one's framework. Just please follow the terms of the liscence. If you create an expansion to GitBot, it'd be great if you could make a pull request and merge it back into this main version (though that isn't required).
