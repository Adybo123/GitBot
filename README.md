# GitBot
A ChatBot for navigating GitHub users, repos and organisations

### What is GitBot?
GitBot is a small project written, majoritively, in one day. It will be improved over time but is basically now what it will be in the future, minus a few features.

### Hosting
You can download GitBot and host it on any PHP-enabled server, but if you don't have one of those, it's officially hosted at: http://www.adybo.co.uk/sites/GitBot
